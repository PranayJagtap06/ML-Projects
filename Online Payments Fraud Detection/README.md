# Online Payments Fraud Detection
In this notebook, I tackled a classification problem related to online payment fraud detection. Given the prevalence of online transactions, accurately identifying whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate is crucial. To address this challenge, I worked with a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for detecting fraud in online payments. You can find the dataset download link within the Google Colab notebook.

The primary objective of this task was to correctly classify payments as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. To achieve this, I initially trained several classification models. By comparing their performances, I ultimately selected the best-performing model for accurate payment classification.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can enhance security and protect users from potential fraudulent activities in the realm of online payments. üõ°Ô∏èüí≥
