# Indian Economy - Foreign Exchange Reserves Prediction
In this notebook I worked on dataset from RBI's (Reserve Bank of India) database. You can download the dataset from the repository or if you want the latest dataset then you can get it by clicking the link given in the google colab notebook. The dataset has some economic indicators which are crucial for country's economy. I had tried to go through each indicator in the dataset tweaking them for EAD and model training. This is a regression task where I had tried to predict the Foreign Exchange Reserves (in US $). For this task I had first train the various regression models and compared their performances and then finally selected the best performing model to predict the future Foreign Exchange Reserves.

Here are some plots which may not be visible in the notebook preview.
